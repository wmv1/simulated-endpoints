### What is this APP for?

Create fake endpoints to be able to access them by other applications, for the purpose of simulating responses

### But how?

Create, update or remove endpoints, see through the "/mocks" route

Access the created endpoint, if it is running locally:

http/localhost:3000/your_end_point/


* Ruby version  
  ruby 2.3.3p222  

* Database creation  
  rake db:setup  
* Rails Verison  
  Rails 5.2.4.3  


Warning:

This APP is just an experiment, there is a lot to improve.
